For customizing admin we need to extend our admin model with ModelAdmin class..
and we need to include field lookups to reflect in the dashboard..


attributes/field lookups in admin :
---------------------------------
list_display  -->takes a list of attributes/coulumns from table to show in the dashboard..
list_filter   ---> filter takes a list of items which should be present in list_display..so that it can gives a filter access
list_editable ---> filter takes a list of items which should be present in list_display..so that it can give a option to edit the data..


import pytz
pytz.all_timezone

list of countries and make a change in settings.py file from UTC-->Asia/Calcutta to get our timezone..


Django-Orm:
-------------
data= ClassName(attributes)
data.save()

data = ClassName.objects.create(attributes)
data.save()

Language.objects.all()---> it gives all the data inside your database..
